This project is about burrows-wheeler transformation. 

Burrows-Wheeler transformation is a method of string transformation that has amazing properties that can be exploited in many ways for various applications. 

In this part of the project I implemented two important functions - one that converts text to its burrows-wheeler transform (brute-force), and another that decodes the burrows-wheeler transform to the original text efficiently using the bijective map or the Last-First map.

I will keep extending this project by building tools such as string compression, exact matching, and approximate matching, and image compression, exact matching, and approximate matching.
